# Pixel-Art-Project-javascript

A single-page web app that allows users to draw pixel art on a customizable canvas!

## instructions:
In this project, I'll use my front-end programming skills including:

1) Defining variables with const and let
2) Accessing the DOM using methods of the document object
3) Declaring functions and attaching them to DOM objects as event listeners
4) Writing nested loops and using loop variables
